Sali Hughes: I met the woman who trolled me online

<b>A few weeks ago, in a chilly London plaza, I met a woman called Becky*. The smart, affluent-looking, 30-something mum smiled warmly as she approached me. We'd never met before. But until fairly recently, Becky had been trolling me online.</b>
</p><p>
Imagine if a group of strangers spent up to 16 hours a day feasting over nasty and imagined details about your personal life and family, telling livelihood-endangering lies about your job.
That happened, and still happens, to me and many others on what's known as a <i>"dragging"</i> or <i>"trashing"</i> site.
</p>
<p>
If you search my name you'll find I'm a journalist. You'll see my posts about beauty and lifestyle all over Twitter and Instagram. But when Becky, searched my name, alongside a cosmetic procedure, a link to the <i>"trashing"</i> site had come up as a result.
The lies about my personal and professional life spanned pages; talking about my children, my marriage and my mother who'd recently died of cancer.

<h2>
False rumours and hurtful insults
</h2>
<p>
The site is an online forum, dedicated to trashing the lives and reputations of people with a social media presence.
Around a year ago, the insults, hurtful conspiracy theories and speculation migrated from that forum to a beauty industry gossip site.
A false rumour appeared, albeit briefly, suggesting I had an undeclared financial relationship with a major brand. I decided I had to act.
</p><p>
I posted a video on Instagram, talking about the ceaseless trolling I - along with many others - had received on the site, how it threatened my livelihood, and affected my mental health and hurt deeply those I love. Having watched that video, Becky stopped posting.
A few months later, she wrote to me. And that eventually led us to meet, shivering, outside a cafe in Victoria, where she had agreed to be interviewed for an edition of <b>File on 4</b> I was making about my experience of online abuse.
</p><p>
In her email to me, Becky had acknowledged there was <i>"a lot of projection going on"</i>. And when we met, she spoke about how issues in her personal life fed into what she wrote.
</p><p>
<i><b>"I think what you see of influencers, people on the Internet, media personalities is potentially only 40 seconds of content a day. It's very easy to fill in with your own narrative.
"For me specifically, I can say 100% what was going on in my own life is reflected in what I postedâ€¦it was nothing really to do with the content creator. It was what I filled in."</i></b>
</p><p>
But while my name may have been on the posts, were the contributors like Becky really talking about me? The Sali Hughes that was being denigrated there was not one I would recognise.
Scant facts would be extrapolated into large fictions. Competition to come up with the juiciest speculation would lead to nonsense being accepted as fact, then more speculation built on top of that, until the person at the centre of the abuse seemed to be a fictional character with my name.
