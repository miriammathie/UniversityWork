I write on my own blog called "BlogbyMir" which I created a few years ago as an escape from how I felt inside. Now, I mostly write poetry, stories or blog posts in French as part of my University course work. Whilst it doesn't receive lots of views, it is a platform that allows me to be my authentic self.

<h3> Interests: </h3>
<p> - I love to write stories, build worlds and characters, which I believe stemmed from my childhood dream of becoming an author.
<br> - Pairing that nicely, I love to read! Mainly fictional books in the fantasy or adventure genre but I dabble in non-fiction on the occassion if it is on a topic that I'm interested in.
<br> - I love to listen to music. I will listen to most genres but my favourites are Kpop and Classical (two VERY different genres but I love them both so much!)
<br> - I am a huge film nerd too and studied media at school. I think that contributed with how obsessed I get with film techniques and cinematography, so we can all blame Mr Townsley!
